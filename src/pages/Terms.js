      <p className="mb-4">
        If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great foodie
        moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds your expectations,
        brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of your food
        excursions – they all count. While we welcome your opinions and
        descriptions of your dining experiences, there are a few things we
        expect from every user on Foodistaan. Your reviews and photos, as well
        as your profile and the comments you share, are all subject to Content
        Guidelines, our Foodie Code of Conduct. If your activity on Foodistaan
        doesn't match up to these content guidelines, we reserve the right to
        take action as we deem necessary. This could include altering or
        deleting your reviews or comments, restricting your review activity or
        deleting your Foodistaan account altogether, with or without notice.
        Foodistaan also utilizes an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious
        reviews. If you see content that does not align with these guidelines or
        our Terms of Service, please let us know. We will consider all reports.
        However, due to the diversity of our community, it is possible that
        content disagreeable to you might not meet the criteria to be removed.

        <strong>Keep out the clutter</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality
        content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140
        characters long for dine-in reviews. That's just about the length of a
        tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover
        the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters.
        We do not have a 140 characters limit for an online order review.
        However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the
        review altogether.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Keep it relevant</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please keep your contributions relevant to Foodistaan. Accounts placing
        irrelevant, inappropriate or promotional content, reviews with server
        names, reviews with similar digital signatures that spam restaurants or
        are based on any already disclaimed or informed policies and practices
        of a restaurant may be deleted without notice. If your review has been
        removed or moderated by us and if you repost another experience for the
        same restaurant, we reserve the right to remove that review too, even
        though such review might be in line with our content guidelines. In the
        case of spam, we can restrict your review activity on Foodistaan.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Keep it clean</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed
        account of your meal, keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and
        lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will delete it
        whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to)
        derogatory comments on someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race,
        gender, religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a
        business and its associates.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Keep it fresh</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one review
        for each online order transaction can be submitted and your most recent
        experience at a place counts. That's what is going to help people when
        they're trying to decide whether or not to eat there. You're free to
        edit and update your review based on subsequent visits at any time.
        Reviews about old experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be
        deleted from our platform.

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Keep it real</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Write your review based on facts and your own experiences (e.g. not a
        friend's or any hearsay experience or based on media reports). Please
        don't exaggerate or falsify your experience. We do not take sides in
        cases of dispute, so make sure you can stand by your word. Content that
        indicates the reviewer hasn't even visited or availed any services from
        the restaurant will be removed. For example, "Never been here, never
        want to. Management is horrible and the food is worse!" Deceptive, fake,
        or misleading reviews will be removed. Reviewing a bunch of fast-food
        outlets in quick succession (even if you eat at them more often than you
        should) is considered suspicious activity, and it's likely these reviews
        will be moderated. Accepting or soliciting a kickback – monetary or
        otherwise – in exchange for reviews or photographs is also not
        acceptable, and could result in removal of your profile.

        limited to accepting money, free meals, drinks) in exchange for reviews,
        or at the threat of negative reviews on Foodistaan, will not be
        tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our
        attention, we reserve the right to delete your Foodistaan profile or

        have a relevant association with a restaurant or its owners, give full
        disclosure in your review. We're sure that honesty is the best policy,
        and other users will respect you even more for it. If you have made it
        to the major league as a food writer or critic, let us know and we can
        provide special access for your blog link to appear with your reviews.

        Guidelines for Restaurants
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Foodistaan is a great way for restaurants to reach out to a vast foodie
        community. A few things you should keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 pl-8 list-disc">
        <li className="my-4 mx-2">
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Keep your listing updated: </strong>
            While our team makes every effort to keep information on Foodistaan
            up-to-date, we appreciate you letting us know when an update is
            required. If your timings change and your listing is not updated,
            customers arriving late won't be too happy with you (or Foodistaan).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li className="my-4 mx-2">
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Don't solicit reviews:</strong>
            &nbsp;The best way to get reviews is to delight customers with your
            food and service. Selective solicitation is a strict NO, and
            offering any type of compensation or kick-back for reviews is
            unfair, so you definitely want to keep away from that, too.

          <ul className="mb-4 pl-8 list-disc">
            <li className="my-4 mx-2">

              Don't offer incentives for users to remove reviews
            </li>
            <li className="my-4 mx-2">
              Don’t ask your staff to compete with each other to collect reviews
            </li>
            <li className="my-4 mx-2">
              Don’t work with companies or third-party vendors/PR agencies

            </li>
            <li className="my-4 mx-2">
              While conducting foodie meetups is allowed, reviews which come in
              lieu of these official gatherings must carry a clear disclaimer
              which will help the others identify that the review is based on an
              invite. That being said, an invite certainly does not mean that
              the user needs to post a positive review
            </li>
            <li className="my-4 mx-2">
              The businesses that do best on Foodistaan are the ones that
              provide a great customer experience to everyone who walks in the
              door without any expectation or encouragement that they write a
              positive review

              If we do come across any evidence (direct/indirect) of you
              indulging in solicitation, we will activate a disclaimer on your
              restaurant's page, informing the Foodistaan community that your
              reviews are suspicious.

            <strong>Respond to criticism positively: </strong>
            Take two deep breaths when you get a negative review. Three, if
            required. This happens to all restaurants who have customers. These
            customers are always right, even when they are wrong. Take the
            unflattering reviews as constructive feedback and use it as an
            opportunity to fix things. Whether you agree with the feedback or
            not, take the criticism in good stride. You can reply with a
            management response to show you care, but please don't use this as a
            platform to hit back or offer the customer an incentive to edit
            their review. Your response can't be edited after posting, so choose
            your words well.

            <strong>Be accountable: </strong>
            Foodistaan will not moderate any questionable activities about your
            restaurant posted in reviews. (e.g. serving shisha where it is not
            permitted, serving alcohol to minors, or staying open later than
            permitted). Foodistaan may also not moderate or delete any reviews
            where any third party service provider is involved. Such a review
            may be retained if it falls within our guidelines. This business
            requires thick skin – stating the perceived attitude of owners or

            Fulfilling the demands of customers who ask for benefits at the
            threat of bad reviews or ratings, sends a message that this behavior
            is tolerated. Similarly, inviting users who have reviewed and given
            a low rating back to the restaurant for a complimentary meal,
            invites false negative reviews. These issues affect the entire
            community and require everyone's participation to curb their
            prevalence. Please report users who engage in such activities to

              right to ensure that infringing products are removed from the
